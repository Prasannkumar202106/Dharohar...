                <h3>Edicts and inscription</h3>
                <p>ancient inscriptions and edicts are regarded as the most reliable source of ancient history because they are generally free of myths and narrate the facts. Epigraphy is the study of inscriptions, while paleography is the study of old writing used in inscriptions and other old records. The first inscriptions discovered were written in Prakrit in the third century B. C. However, with the arrival of Ashoka-The Great, the practice of writing inscriptions became popular. Seals, stone pillars, pebbles, copper plates, temple walls and bricks, and pictures were all used to engrave inscriptions. </p>

                    <p>Commonly known as the “Land of Seven Sisters”, North-East India is the easternmost region of the country. North-East India is a rendezvous of multiple communities, faiths, and cultures. Today it comprises 8 states namely Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura - often called “The Seven Sisters”, and Sikkim - referred to as the “Brother” to the seven states. It is believed that these specific names were given to this region due to their interdependence on each other. North-East India is officially part of the North Eastern Council (NEC), constituted in 1971 as the nodal agency for the development of the northeastern states. The entire region is connected to the mainland through a narrow strip of land known as the “Chicken Neck”, which was created in 1947. The city of Guwahati in Assam is regarded as the “Gateway to the North-East”. Bestowed with rich natural resources, history, culture, and traditions, Northeast India is a reservoir of bewitching diversity.</p>

                    <h3>Inscription tour</h3>
                    <p> The study of inscriptions is known as epigraphy and an inscription is anything written or engraved on something such as stone, wood, metal, ivory plagues, bronze statues, bricks, clay, shells pottery etc. Epigraphy includes deciphering the text of inscriptions and analyzing the information they contain. It also includes paleography that is the study of ancient writing. The first literary reference to writing and written documents occur in Buddhist Pali texts, especially the jatakas and Vinayapitaka. The brahmi of Ashokan inscriptions seems a fairly developed script and must have had a prior history of at least a few centuries. Recently important direct evidence that Brahmi existed in pre-mauryan times has come from Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka, where excavations unearthed potsherds with short inscriptions (probably names of people) that can be dated to at least the early 4th century B. C.</p>
